•	Installation:
1.	Clone the repository: git clone [repository URL]
2.	Navigate to project folders: cd client and cd server
3.	Install dependencies: npm install
4.	Set up environment variables

5. Folder Structure
•	Client:
o	src/components: Reusable React components.
o	src/pages: Screens for different routes.
